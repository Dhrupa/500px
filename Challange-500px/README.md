# 500px Challange

## Solution

In My solution  tried to cover following stuff

### Task 1 - Photo Showcase
Create a simple app to showcase Popular photos from 500px. Specifically, it should show photos in our “Popular” feature dynamically obtained from the 500px API. 
Here  I have tried user still continuely able to browse photos but as i can only get 20 photo on each server call and Max 100 so you will see data reflecting in grid view as it has shoring by name, allowing users to browse through multiple pages of content.

### Task 2 - Photo Details
When user clicks on a photo on the grid, a full screen version of the photo should be displayed along with more detailed information about the photo, such as its title.
